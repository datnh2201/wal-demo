Of course. I have added a section on performance improvements to the `README.md` file.

# Understanding Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

This project is a simple demonstration to help understand the concept of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and its role in ensuring transaction durability and isolation in database systems.

## What is Write-Ahead Logging?

Write-Ahead Logging is a method for providing atomicity and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems. The central idea is that changes to data files (where tables and indexes reside) must be written only after those changes have been logged.


## How it Works

1.  **Log First:** Before any changes are made to the actual data pages on disk, a log record present the change action is written to a separate log file on stable storage.
2.  **Commit:** A transaction is considered "committed" once its corresponding log record has been successfully written to the log file.
3.  **Apply Changes:** The actual changes to the data files can be written later, at a more convenient time (e.g., during a checkpoint or when the memory buffer is full).
4.  **Recovery:** In case of a system crash before the changes is written to the disk, the recovery process reads the log. It can redo the changes of committed transactions that weren't yet applied to the data files and undo the changes of incomplete transactions.

## Performance Improvement

The use of WAL significantly improves database performance by adopting the nature performance of disk I/O operations.

*   **Sequential vs. Random Writes:** Writing to the log is a sequential append operation, which is much faster than the random writes required to update various data pages scattered across the disk.
*   **Reduced I/O:** Instead of flushing every modified data page to disk for each transaction, only the log record needs to be written. The actual data page writes can be batched and performed more efficiently in the background, reducing the overall I/O load and improving transaction throughput.

## How to Run

This project uses Gradle. You can build and run it using the following commands:

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the main application
./gradlew run
```

Disclaimer: Please note that this implementation is for demonstration purposes only to illustrate how WAL works. It is not optimized for performance, may not handle all possible bugs or edge cases, and is not intended for production use.
